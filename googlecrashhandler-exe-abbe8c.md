The version 1.3.35.421 of this file is generally safe and is not considered a virus or malware, as it is part of the official software package for Chrome; however, like any executable, it can be mimicked by malicious software, so it's essential to ensure that the file is located in the correct directory, typically within the Google Chrome installation folder. Users may occasionally encounter errors related to GoogleCrashHandler.exe, such as crashes or failures to send reports, but these issues are usually resolved with updates or by reinstalling the browser. Overall, while the file serves an important function in maintaining the browser's reliability, users should remain vigilant and use antivirus software to ensure their system's security.
